# DuaDaily-SMS
automate daily duas sent via SMS

<hr>

Uses the Twilio API and Firebase Cloud Functions to listen for incoming messages (Keywords: DUA or QUIT) to have users opt-in/opt-out and then schedules a daily dua (islamic supplication) to be sent out to all opted in users. Uploaded the Firebase functions here, with my API keys and phone number revoked.

Duas were pulled from https://github.com/osamayy/azkar-db
